# About me

I'm a software developer from Uruguay with a passion for Elixir and functional programming. My journey started at WyeWorks, where I was introduced to Elixir's elegant concurrency model and declarative style.

Over the years, I've contributed to a wide variety of web applications as a full-stack developer, often working in highly collaborative, cross-functional teams. My main focus has been backend engineering with Elixir, but I'm also experienced with Phoenix LiveView and React.

I’ve worked on projects ranging from financial platforms to educational tools, helping teams ship scalable and maintainable code. I believe in lean processes and love working in environments where teams can ship fast and often without compromising quality.

I’m especially drawn to building tools that help other developers, contributing to open source, and sharing knowledge through talks and articles.
